# BlackBookDB
My own key value db in python (for learning some data structures and also dbms)

Things to do:

- [ ] Storage
- [ ] Query Interface
- [ ] CRUD

Here is somebody who had similar questions, wrote his db in c.

I'll try to do it in python coz it's easy to understand and implement. And translating his code from c to python for my database would reinforce my learning.

I hope to complete this before I have to write my final exam for database management systems course, I do not have it in this term so no rush.

PS: I have failed it before, and had it for 2 consecutive terms... I am on a break.
